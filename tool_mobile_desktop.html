        <div class="panel-body">
<div id="content-text"><p id="p0"><span id="p0s0">Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class.</span><span id="p0s1"> Professor: OK, we've been talking about early agriculture in the near east, so let's concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it.</span><span id="p0s2"> Let's look at Catalhoyuk, Catalhoyuk, that's about as close as we get in English.</span><span id="p0s3"> It's Turkish, really, the sites in modern day Turkey, and who knows what the original inhabitants called it.</span><span id="p0s4"> Catalhoyuk wasn't the first agricultural settlement in the near east, but it was pretty early, settled about 9000 years ago in the Neolithic period.</span><span id="p0s5"> And the settlement,ah,town really, lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people.</span><span id="p0s6"> That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time.</span><span id="p0s7">
</span></p><p id="p1"><span id="p1s0">One of the things that make the settlement of this size impressive is the time period.</span><span id="p1s1"> It's the Neolithic, remember, the late Stone Age.</span><span id="p1s2">
</span></p><p id="p2"><span id="p2s0">So the people that lived there had only stone tools, no metals.</span><span id="p2s1"> So everything they accomplished, like building this town, they did with just stone, plus wood, bricks, that sort of thing.</span><span id="p2s2"> But you got to remember that it wasn't just any stone they had, they had obsidian, and obsidian is a black, volcanic, well, almost like glass.</span><span id="p2s3"> It flakes very nicely into really sharp points, and the sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of obsidian.</span><span id="p2s4"> And the people of Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland, from central Turkey, traded for it, probably.</span><span id="p2s5"> Anyway, what I wanna focus on is the way the town was built: the houses are all rectangular, one storey made of sun dried bricks.</span><span id="p2s6">
</span></p><p id="p3"><span id="p3s0">But what's really interesting is that there are no spaces between them, no streets in other words, and so generally no doors on the houses either.</span><span id="p3s1"> People walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the roof, down a wooden ladder.</span><span id="p3s2"> You can still see the diagonal marks of the ladders in the plaster on the inside walls.</span><span id="p3s3"> Once you were in the house, there would be one main room and a couple of small rooms for storage: the main room had the hearths, for cooking and for heat.</span><span id="p3s4"> It would've been pretty cold during the winters, and it also looks like they made their tools near the fire.</span><span id="p3s5"> There tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes, but no chimney.</span><span id="p3s6"> The smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves, so there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out.</span><span id="p3s7"> You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there.</span><span id="p3s8">
</span></p><p id="p4"><span id="p4s0">You can see on the walls, which they plastered and decorated with paintings.</span><span id="p4s1"> They ended up with a layer of black soot on them, and so did people's lungs.</span><span id="p4s2"> The bones found in the graves show a layer of soot on the inside of the ribs, and that's another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk, the burial sites.</span><span id="p4s3"> The graves have all been found under the houses, right under the floors, and it maybe this burial custom that explains why the houses were packed in so tightly without streets.</span><span id="p4s4"> I mean, you might think it was for protection or something, but there has been no evidence found yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger.</span><span id="p4s5"> It maybe they wanted to live as near as possible to their ancestors' graves and be buried near them themselves, but it makes a good point.</span><span id="p4s6">
</span></p><p id="p5"><span id="p5s0">Based on excavations, we can know the layout of the houses and the location of the graves, but we're only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way.</span><span id="p5s1"> That's the way it is with archeology, you are dealing with the physical remains that people left behind.</span><span id="p5s2"> We have no sure access to what they thought and how they felt about things, I mean it's interesting to speculate, and the physical artifacts can give us clues, but there is a lot we can't really know.</span><span id="p5s3"> So, for instance, their art, they painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them.</span><span id="p5s4"> Now they did hunt and they also raised cereal crops and kept sheep, but we don't know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes.</span><span id="p5s5"> Was it supposed to have religious or magical significance? That's the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues.</span><span id="p5s6"> And hopefully, further excavation of Catalhoyuk will yield more clues, but we'll probably never know for sure.</span><span id="p5s7"></span></p></div>
